# Revolution21
In the advent you are downloading this straight from the github:
1. Ensure you are downloading it and unzipping to the C:/Users/[username]/documents/paradox interactive/Hearts of Iron 4/mod folder.
2. The local directory for the mod may be addressed for my own personal machine, in which case just change it to your respective username.
3. Lastly if the .mod file downloads into the rev21 folder, just pull it out to be beside the rev21 folder which is in the Hearts of Iron 4/mod folder.
